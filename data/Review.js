The wings were not properly cooked. The flavour on the wings were terrible and there was barely any sauce. I had to throw more than half the wings because my guests were awfully confused at what type of wings we ordered.

I wish the cook had tasted it before sendong to us. The sesame chicken was bone dry, chewy and tasteless. The rice quality and quantity was also not upto the mark. With such food quality, this resturant will surely not remain on my choice list. Unless some responsible person at this restaurant looks into ensuring consistency in food quality, their business will go nose down and that will be a shame.",

Pepper beef) but the chicken chow mein tasted good but smelt bad so I had only a little. My guest ate more and complained of digestive problem. It was most embarrassing. I still have some left in case you want to check. Please tell me what to do. This has never happened with other deliveries. Salam Dr Khan",

    reviewDescription: "The classic beef burger was great when I had it. I hope you keep the quality and improve even more.  The critique I have is that the bun to meat ratio is off. The meat diameter is less compared to the bun which can make it feel more bready than meaty. I would recommend adding another 10-20gms to the patty and increasing its diameter. Otherwise, good stuff. [Add an option for beef/turkey bacon too] Very pleasant experience otherwise :)",

Extremely overpriced , extremely small serving and zero value for money. Absolutely not recommended. My first negative review on foodpanda in 3 years but this restaurant deserves it",

The only thing right in that order was the sesame chicken. I will never be ordering from here. You spend so much money for a meal and they just send you bad food.",

Bun was stale soggy and flat, the sad sorry salad inside was stale as well drowned in a mayonnaise base (specifically requested for no mayonnaise!) If the beef burger itself had any merit it was overshadowed by lack of quality and TASTE in other things-  a signature  sauce HAS to be more than store bought disgusting mayonnaise.",

It's not one full sausage but 2 small chicken sausages, I believe they're those K&Ns sausages. You're basically paying for someone to cook and assemble store bought ingredients. A very underwhelming experience. Tastes okay but it's exactly what you would expect from just assembling the store bought things. Order them if you really want hot dogs and don't have an alternative and are too lazy to assemble ingredients yourself.",

In this tag one can get a well satisfying panini from Tahzeeb etc.  On quality of food it has less chicken and more mayo/cheese/ sause they need to improve their style.",

I called to discuss why they sent the wrong order and they started defending themselves by saying the order was right; I sent them a picture of the order to which they said they added more gravy to the chilli dry because customers demanded it. Wow.   When incompetent people run restaurants like this without listening to the customers‚Äô genuine complaint, they are bound to not survive in the market. Good luck to you running a business like this.",

It was very thoughtfully packed and was super hot and fresh. Huge thumbs up on thatüëçüèº. Second was taste. I would say   deliciously made . I enjoyed every bite i took. Agar aik aloo b daal dete tu kafi mazidar ho jata. That's something i really missed having. Aik aur cheez agar improve ho saky put few more pieces of that beef:) ,, that will make it more amazing. Raita n salad was on point too. Quantity was also reasonably good though i wanted some more beef chunks in it. All in all, superb job on this. Thank you for making my taste buds happyüòÇ( and mind you, i have very picky taste in general)üòÅ",

If you wanna waste money then surely this is the restraunt for you but if you wanna eat decent food this ain't it.

But unfortunately the food was not hot rather like warm.I am not sure, why there was no Arabian rice in the menu, as I had an excellent experience with their rice and was disappointed not to find the rice in their menu. Hope they will restart the rice dish.",

They only delivered burgers which didn't look zingers at all because its patty was so small that it looked like a wing and then i filed a complaint but no one took action against it. Do basically food pamda is defending those restaurants who are scamming people, i will surely use social media to let people know about you and you scams and they way you guys defend them i didn't ate them i throw them away because no one was eating that.I filed the complaint yesterday 2 times buht i don't thinj any kind of action was taken. As a blogger i will let people know how you and your restaurants are scamming peopleTotally it was a pathetic experience.",
